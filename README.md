# yk.abstractions

A collection of bpatcher and low-level abstractions for Max programming environment.

## Installation

yk.abstractions is distributed as a Max package available in this GitHub repo. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/programsounds/yk.abstractions/releases) and copy the uncompressed package to:

- **Mac**: `~/Documents/Max 8/Packages/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Max 8\Packages\`

## System Requirements

### Max version

Max 8.6+

### Windows Compatibility

Currently, those abstractions that use `yk.<=p`, `yk.<p`, `yk.==p`, `yk.>=p`, `yk.>p` do not work in Max in Windows, because the OS does not support the special characters. These abstractions will be replaced with new abstractions in a future update.

## Notes on the Modules

### Build-in module documentation

Detailed information about the modules and their paramters is available in the `info` subpatcher of the individual modules' UI.

### Scheduler in Overdrive

`Schedule in Overdrive` in Max Audio Status must be turned on for the proper operation of the modules.

### Modules with multiple output channel versions

Some FX modules have 1ch, 2ch, 8ch versions for the audio output. The modules share the same [receive message prefix](#module-prefixes-and-descriptions). This is because the modules have the identical parameters. The distinction in use should be made by assigning different ID number (i.e., the bpatcher's frist argument).

### yk.crossbarSwitch

yk.crossbarSwitch64 and 128 are subpatchers and stored in `clippings/IO/crossbarSwitch`. This is because yk.crossbarSwitch uses a preset object to save its setting separately from the parent pattr preset chain. Max patches can utilize them instantly from the context menu: `Paste From -> yk.abstractions -> IO -> crossbarSwitch`. 

### Spectral FX modules

- The spectral FX modules can create a DSP chain with  **symbolic connection** in order to avoid unnecessary analysis/resynthesis by fftin~ and fftout~. The spectral modules in the DSP chain needs to be set to the `ext` mode.
- FFT sizes 1024, 2048, and 4096 are available in the spectral FX modules. The overlap factors are 4, 8, and 8 respectively. The FFT sizes are synchronized when they are set to the same ID number.
  - The exceptions are FFT size 16384 (overlap factor 16) in yk.spectralMorphBP and 1024 (overlap factor 2) in yk.spectralFM. The signals in these modes are available only from the internal output.
- yk.spectralMixer is the utility module which allows for parallel processing and feedback of signal which are all undertaken within a single set of fftin~ and fftout~. Moreover, yk.spectralRouter allows for flexible frequency domain signal routing between the connected spectral modules. Therefore, the user is able to construct a larger set of spectral FX modules, a spectral FX suite, flexibly without sacrificing the CPU usage, audio quality deterioration, and latency caused by the sequential analysis and resynthesis. See the test patches of yk.spectralMixer and yk.spectralRouter for examples.

### Musical Information Retrieval

A set of modules in the `Sensors` category provides functionalities to extract audio descriptors by analyzing the incoming sound spectrum. The following table shows the target descriptors and the type of modules to use to extract them. The test patches of the corresponding modules exemplify their usesâ€”especially yk.dispatcherBP shows a **1 x n** mapping example.
